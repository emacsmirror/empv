* 5.0.0

- Added a new public variable =empv-current-media-title=. You can use this for various stuff, like putting the song name in the ~global-mode-line~ etc.
- Improved the toggling of video display. When video is enabled, the mpv window now appears immediately (even before buffering completes), this should improve the experience with video toggling.
- Improved event displaying on certain situations, like video visibility changes and pause status changes. Now you should see events for them in the echo area.
- Added a dedicated hydra for empv commands, with notes in the README for usage. Thanks @oreodave!
- Fixed customization types for improved compatibility with Emacs customization. Thanks @Ban3.
- Added =empv-playlist-load-from-file=, allowing playlist selection and playback from =empv-playlist-dir=. This is now bound to "L" in =empv-map=.
- Enabled playback of remote files via SFTP for SSH/SSHX Tramp URIs, ensuring seamless operation both locally and remotely. Thanks @oreodave!
- Added the ability to bookmark all types of URLs, including radio streams and Subsonic resources. (See ~empv-bookmark-set~ and ~empv-bookmark-jump~ functions.)
- Now displays bookmarked radio channels under a separate "Favorites" group.
- Warns user to configure =empv-invidious-instance= when missing (improves troubleshooting).
- Improved color readability in the =empv-display-current= function.

  - You can also search for channels using ~empv-youtube-channel~. Selecting a channel will trigger the workflow I mentioned above.
- Various quality of life improvements.

* 3.0.0

- Moved ~embark~ support into another file, ~empv-embark.el~. Now you need to ~require~ this file to be able to call ~empv-initialize-embark~.
- Removed ~versuri~. I'll add a different, more accurate method for getting lyrics for given song.
- Added capture functionality to ~empv-log-current-radio-song-name~. Now you can add arbitrary text along with the song name while you are capturing it, just call ~empv-log-current-radio-song-name~ with prefix argument. (Simply do ~C-u~ before calling it)
- Fixes:
  - Fixed some bindings.
  - Did a code clean-up, cleared all byte compile warnings.
  - Fixed a memory leak.

* 2.0.0

- ~consult-empv.el~ is removed. Now ~empv.el~ integrates itself with ~consult~ automatically, if it's found on your system. Use default functions instead of ~consult-empv-*~ functions. (e.g. Use ~empv-youtube~ instead of ~consult-empv-youtube~).
- Better ~embark~ support. (Add ~(empv-initialize-embark)~ to your init file to enable it.)
  - Now you can do ~embark-act~ on a file or folder anywhere in Emacs and you'll get the following actions:
    - ~empv-play~
    - ~empv-enqueue~

    - ~empv-playlist-move~ → Move playlist item to selected place (~top~, ~bottom~, ~next~, ~index~).

- New functions:
  - ~empv-enqueue-next~ → Add item to playlist as next item to play.
  - ~empv-copy-path~
- ~read-multiple-choice~ is the default action selector, instead of ~completing-read~. See the ~empv-action-handler~ variable, if you want to use old behavior.
- YouTube tabulated mode changes:
  - It uses =P= instead of =p= to start playing current result. =p= is bound to ~previous-line~ and =n= is bound to next line. Also =j= and =k= are bound to ~next-line~ and ~previous-line~ respectively.
  - New binding: =c=. Shows comments of current result in a nicely formatted org buffer.

- Misc:
  - More echo area messages to inform user about what's going on.
  - Better playlist management.
    - Instead of showing path/uri, show media title whenever it's possible. (This is generally only possible after the media is played, not before.)
